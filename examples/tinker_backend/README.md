# Tinker-compatible backend

Serve many LoRA training runs on one shared base model through a
[tinker](https://tinker-docs.thinkingmachines.ai/)-style operation API: clients
drive training with explicit `forward_backward` / `optim_step` operations and
sample through the shared engines — no dataset, no reward function, and no
batch schedule on the server.

## Launch

```bash
python train_tinker_backend.py \
  --tinker-backend \
  --multi-lora-n-adapters 4 \
  --lora-rank 32 --lora-alpha 64 \
  --target-modules all-linear \
  --hf-checkpoint Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
  ... # the usual megatron/sglang flags; see run_tinker_backend.py
```

Key flags:

| flag | meaning |
|------|---------|
| `--tinker-backend` | enable the operation backend (requires `--multi-lora-n-adapters > 0`) |
| `--multi-lora-n-adapters N` | fixed slot count; a registration binds a slot for life (queue when full) |
| `--lora-rank` / `--lora-alpha` | deployment-wide ceiling / fixed alpha — clients may lower `rank`, never set `alpha` |
| `--multi-lora-disable-service-mode` | exit once all adapters retire (by default the service keeps serving with zero adapters) |
| `--tinker-max-coalesce-wait-s` | how long one train call coalesces additional ready client batches |
| `--tinker-max-empty-wait-s` | idle-queue yield back to the control phase (keep this small) |

## Operation contract

`enqueue_operation(name, operation_id, ordinal, kind, payload)` — ordinals are
consecutive per registration starting at 1; arrival may be out of order
(gap-buffered, and a hole-filling ordinal is always admitted), execution is
strictly ordinal-ordered; retries with the same `operation_id`, same ordinal,
and identical payload return the original operation — anything else is a
typed conflict.

| kind | payload | success result |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `forward_backward` | `{samples: [Datum...], loss: {loss_fn, loss_fn_config?}}` | `{logprobs: [[...]], metrics: {"loss:sum", "unmasked_tokens:sum"}}` |
| `forward` | `{samples: [Datum...]}` | `{logprobs: [[...]]}` (zero gradient, structurally) |
| `optim_step` | `{adam_params: {learning_rate, beta1, beta2, eps, weight_decay, grad_clip_norm}}` | `{grad_norm, learning_rate}` |
| `save_weights_for_sampler` | `{}` | `{serving_version, serving_name}` — completes only after the weights are live |
| `save_state` | `{tag?, ttl_seconds?}` | `{path, step}` (named states are immutable) |
| `load_state` | `{path}` | `{step, path}` (re-publishes on the next push) |

`Datum = {tokens, response_length, loss_mask, loss_weights?, advantages?, rollout_log_probs?}`
— per-token channels align with the response span. Losses reduce as plain
token sums (`Σ(-logp·w)` for `cross_entropy`), so K chunked forward_backward
calls accumulate exactly like one; `loss_weights` own the scale and no server
normalization or scheduler ever touches a tinker slot. Result `metrics` use
the SDK combiner's `name:reduction` keys.

Operation states: `QUEUED → CLAIMED → SUCCEEDED | FAILED(user|server) | CANCELLED`;
poll `get_operation`, then `ack_operation` to release the record. In v1 these
verbs are the controller actor's Ray API (registration/status are the only
HTTP routes); backpressure raises a retryable `OperationBackpressure` — the
future tinker HTTP frontend maps it to 429 + Retry-After, never to a 4xx the
SDK treats as fatal. Deregistering fences every open operation of that
registration as `FAILED(user)`.

## v1 compatibility matrix

Supported: text-only input; the synchronous training loop; 1-D shifted
targets; `loss_fn ∈ {cross_entropy, importance_sampling, ppo}` (per-op clip
config); per-call AdamParams; multi-chunk gradient accumulation with
independent `optim_step`; latest-only sampler weights behind the publish
barrier; named immutable `save_state` / `load_state` (create-from-checkpoint
included, shape-fenced); optional `num_step` auto-retirement.

Explicitly rejected (boundary error, never a silent fallback): multimodal
inputs; nested `(N, K)` top-K targets; other loss functions (CISPO, DRO, ...);
client-set `alpha`; non-finite/out-of-domain AdamParams; a loss's required
per-token channels missing; `response_length == len(tokens)` (targets are
shifted); async/off-policy sampling against pinned snapshots;
cross-world-size state restore; state restore into a slot whose per-rank
optimizer ownership differs from the save (cross-slot restore under DP
sharding — always safe under DP=1); idle slot GC.
